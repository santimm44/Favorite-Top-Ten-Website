                    Natalya Shelburne has a one pager portfolio. 
                    Rather simple and a bit baren, but where there is a lack of content the web page makes up with cool visuals. 
                    When you load into the page the self portrait comes to as wireframes start connecting in an interesting manny forming the image.
                    <br> I am slightly disappointed in the fact some of the links lead to dead webpages. 
                    It may just be that Natalya Shelburne has not updated the web page in sometime.

                <p >
                  Rogie also has a one-pager, but the aesthetic is *muah* chef's kiss.
                  I love how it looks like a combination of a game start screen and an old timey cartoon.
                  When you hover over the buttons you hear a little sfx and see a little image where Rogie's name is, replacing it with cool art.
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                  My only qualm with Rogie's web pportfolio, and that is that the website resembles more of a link tree website than a website portfolio.
                  Rogie does show off their skills with this page, but it host none of their projects, list of experiences, and other sections that a website portfolio can host.
                  I think if Rogie added another page or just a section to host a few pieces of their artwork in a gallery section.
                  That would take the portfolio up a notch.

              <h5><a href="http://lbebber.github.io/public/#contact" target="_blank">Website Portfolio</a></h5>
                <p>
                    Lucas Bebber's one page portfolio is not only visually appealing, but also structured really well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An ameature, like myself, can break down everything into 5 sections. 
                  The first being the navigation bar. The second is the hero section. 
                  The following are the "About" section, "Work" section, and "Contact" section wich doubles as a footer.
                  The structure being so clear cut helps a lot and shows great attention to detail from the Lucas Bebber.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Again, this site doesn't seem to be well updated.
                  Scrolling down the page you can take a gander as to when the last time the site was updated.
                  Under the work area of the site you notice there are links to articles.
                  Each one has a title and subtitle.
                  If you look closely you will notice the last article Lucas Bebber was from 2016.
                  Nothing else has dates on the site, that I can notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think if Lucas Bebber were to regulary update this site, even if only once a year, then this would be great.
                  If not, then I would try not including any dates at all.
                  I would be under the impression that the person had no notable work experiences for years or that the site isn't maintained.
                  I know it isn't the former of the two as Lucas Bebber's Github shows they have been actively committing to projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This site seems fully decked out with styling.
                    In both a good and bad way. 
                    The effects are some of the best I have seen.
                    However, the landing page is not clear with its call to action.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let's start with how cool the styling is.
                  When you load into the landing page it has a cool loading scene where there is a counter.
                  Once you are in you see some awesome things and as you move your mouse you will immediately notice the background text interacts like a paddle through water creating ripples where you move.
                  All the font is very decorative and every 9 seconds the page would show a now project Du Haihang has made.
                  When you click the image of the project it will take you to another scene with all the information regarding the project
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, the bad stuff.
                  The design and layout isn't intuitive. 
                  I had to play around with the site for a few minutes to get a bit of understanding of what I meant to possibly do.
                  At first, I thought, "is there only two pages in this portfolio? Maybe it is not finished."
                  That wasn't the case, so I came to find out by playing around and randomly clicking to places.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The CSS not being the most intuitive was one bad part the second would be that this portfolio lacks any information about the person themselves or how to reach them.
                  Similar to the other web portfolios I found this website doesn't appear to be maintained. 
                  Clicking into the projects you would notice that the latest project was back in 2016.
                  Then I realized when I was trying to find out if they host more recent work in another platform that there was no information outside of the person's name, title, and projects.
                  This is a major design flaw for a website portfolio.
                  Employers who are interested in hiring this person would have no way of reaching out to them. 
                  The last thing you should make a possible employer do is start hunting you down via online searches since chances are they would not want to waste their time in a goose hunt.

                <p>
                    OK, so I immediately began looking for dates on this site... 
                    The latest date from the webstire is from April, 2024!!!
                </p>
                <p>Yeah, baby!!! Let's go! That's what I am talking about! Woooo</p>
                <p>
                  OK, so right off the bat the Hero section is fantastic.
                  It is concise and minimalistic.
                  I think the minimalism was done well here.
                  You have their name, title, subtitle, specialties, and links to reach them.
                  Thumbs up all around. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the navigation there are links to three pages.
                  The current home page, a projects page, and a blog page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The home page houses an "About me" section along with sections that show a bit of what's in the project and blog page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The project's page is nice, but is a bit barren, visually.
                  Only four projects have been archived here.
                  I think if there are few projects like this then it would be better to give them sections each.
                  The sections can go further into what Abdul Rahman has done in them and highlight how he solved problems with their skills and how they omprove coming out of the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Articles are also a bit baren.
                  I would guess that Abdul Rahman is not very serious about posting blogs.
                  That's fine.
                  However, there are 5 blog posts in the last 5 years... 
                  They are not yearly blogs either, but just inconsistent releases.

                <p>
                  This web portfolio is a very clean design.
                  Another one-pager with great styling.
                  Emeruche Ikenna separated the page into 4 main areas.
                  The hero section, about me section, projects, and blog.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Looking through blog I notice that the most recent blog is from Aug 21, 2024.
                  It appears that this web portfolio is being updated.
                  Yay!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I initially thought the website was a one pager, but I was, in fact, deceived.
                  If we scroll to the articles there is a "view more" button. 
                  clicking the button you will be taken to another page hosting all of Emeruche Ikenna's articles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  immediately, the hero section is great.
                  A picture of Emeruche Ikenna is shown with styling applied and a button to email them and a button to download a copy of their resume.
                  Great.
                  There is also a really cool bar/section with the skills of Emeruche Ikenna.
                  All of these details in the hero will be great eye catchers for employees.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Unlike my other takes, I couldn't find anything that I particularly have issues with as I find this site well maintained and well thought out and planned.

                <p>
                    This one fumbled quite a bit to be honest.
                    I really like the visual design of everything.
                    The colors pop out really well.
                    The text appearing as if someone is typing is pretty cool.
                    But that is it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Erik Henrique web portfolio has a lot of potential, but here is where it fumbled.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First the navigation bar.
                  The navigation bar doesn't work. 
                  Six buttons and only one works.
                  It is the "Hire me :)" button which takes you to Erik Henrique's LinkedIn.
                  That's great, but the following buttons: Projects, Experiences, Blog, Skillset/tools do not work!
                   Yes, you can scroll down to get to those sections, but if you are telling an employer to look at your portfolio and something as basic as linking buttons can't be done then what does that say about the developer?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second big fumble is the project section. 
                  Only one project is listed.
                  If we visit Erik Henrique's Github we see they have contributed 205 times this year.
                  If we compare the Github, project section, and the Skillset/tools then we would be left confused.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Github is essentially telling us that Erik Henrique makes small amounts of contributions throughout the year.
                  The project section speaks of only one project.
                  Lastly the skillsets/tools show 37 different technologies and languages Erik Henrique is, to mildly, familiar with to use in a project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If not for the aesthetic I probably wouldn't have included this as one of my favorites to be honest and transparent.
                </p>

              <h5><a href="https://rtdevcraft.com/" target="_blank">Website Portfolio</a></h5>
                <p>
                    I think this is the first responsive website portfolio I have seen.
                    I don't know what the break point is, but the designer put some extra effort into making sure it is responsive.
                    This is nice since likely if someone searches for Rachel Tschanz's website portfolio on their phone they will see a version that is more compatible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Immediately I see unique elements in this page.
                  The photo carousel has a nice touch to it. 
                  Resembling both a carousel and a flush accordian.
                  When you move onto the an image it will close the prior one as it expands the prior or next image.
                  Not only that, but it has buttons and text above the image itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The toolbox sections also appears to be a looping carousel.
                  Which looks great.
                  The loop, unlike the one I saw in one of the other example, does not have a hiccup when looping back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The about me page, the second page and last page, Is well done too in that it is concise while still having some flare to it.
                  Unlike other about me pages, Rachel Tschanz really personalizes her about me page where you can somewhat grasp on who she is as a person.
                  I don't see this often, which is strange that it is not commonly being done.
                  This will help you stand out to employers, even if it is a tad bit more.
                  Which can give you the edge as you would may be more memorable than someone who speaks nothing about themselves

              <h5><a href="https://vivek9patel.github.io/" target="_blank">Website Portfolio</a></h5>
                <p>
                    OK, ok, I will admit that I have a bit of a bias here.
                    This person, Vivek Patel, made the site look and operate like a linux system.
                    How cool is that!
                    Cool enough for me, ha!
                </p>
                <p>
                  As for it being a website portfolio... 
                  If you are an employer who is a tech geek and a Linux user then this would be a pretty website portfolio.
                  However, if the employer is neither then this may fall flat.
                  It is not the most decorated nor informational.
                  To the right of the screen you will see two relavent shortcuts: "About Vivek" and "Contact Me"
                </p>
                <p>
                  No shortcuts for projects, skills, education, or resume.
                  I am not saying Vivek Patel doesn't have these things.
                  They do, but it's in a small menu within the "About Vivek" folder.
                  It is pretty hard to notice right away and if you do miss it I can't blame you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also, there are no updates. 
                  If there is then I can't as the projects are the only thing that appear to have a clear date on them.
                  The last project appears to be from April 2021.
                  Strangely, this website was there last project...  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall it is a pretty cool site, but I would hope Vivek Patel would update it.
                  Also, to create the shortcuts buttons for all the things he want visitors to see
                </p>

                    Last one, let's go!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chuck Smith is an interesting one.
                  Interesting because Chuck Smith does not have anything except for blog posts. 
                  To call this a website portfolio is a big stretch, but I still wanted to highlight their site.
                  Mainly to point at the simplicity and point out that it is made rather well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reading a few of their posts it seems like a lot are tutorial, which makes sense as he tags majority of those in the first page as a tutorial.
                  The blogs/articles are done rather professionaly and are detailed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yes, there hasn't been a recent update, but is slightly more forgivable as they made a lot for a single person.
                  They seem to have been on a roll for a few years before stopping the blog posts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If we look into their socials, specifically Github, we will see they have been committing a lot.
                  In the past year they made around 724 contributions!
                  Wowza!
                  That's a lot of code.
                </p>
