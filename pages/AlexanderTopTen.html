              The heavy and powerful Hydra Splatling can be really fun, so long as you're at a distance. While it takes a while to fully charge the weapon, the rapid fire of the weapon makes it a really frightening weapon to encounter in a battle.
            </p>
            <p>
              It excells well in Splat Zones to get control of the zone(s) quickly. Its drawback comes from its weight and slow charging, which can make you a fish out of water if you get cornered. They say keep your friends close and your enemies closer, but you certainly do not want this to happen to you. 
            </p>
            <p>
              To keep said enemies out of your sight, this kit is equipped with the Autobombs. Autobombs will easily alert you if an enemy is near its vicinity, and even if the bomb misses its mark, you will at least have a good general idea of where your targets are.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your special weapon is the Booyah Bomb, charging the bomb with the cheers of your allies can easily take out, or at the very least scatter, any enemies near its giant explosion radius, buying your team the time to regain the upper edge in the objective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, it's perfect to try once you get used to the gameplay of easier Splatlings. Definitely, I would say give it a try!
            </p>

            The Inkline Tri-Stringer has two firing modes: tapping to paint and holding to charge the arrows. When charged halfway, the arrows shoot at a seperate angle, but when fully charged, all arrows are concentrated to the middle, and the range of the bow is increased, which can be used to take out opponents from far away.
          </p>
          <p>
            This kit makes use of the Sprinkler sub weapon. While not the best to defeat opponents, it can be placed to slowly paint a set area its in, which can help you get your special ready!
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of, the special is the Super Chump. It's a cannon that launches dummy balloons in a set location, mimicking the jump that players usually do when moving to another teammate, before exploding together if the enemy can't destroy them in time. They're mostly for displacement and painting, which makes it really good for modes such as Splat Zones, where painting the main zone is crucial, or Clam Blitz, which can deter other enemy players from scoring their Power Clam.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I really enjoy using this weapon! It's really good for getting a lot of paint on the turf, which can give your team the upperhand when pushing for the objective!

            The Splatana Stamper is an insane concept for a weapon! It's a chainsaw-esque sword weapon made out of a date stamp. Perfectly fitting considering that kissing the end of the sword usually marks your expiriy date right then and there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tapping the fire button allows it to swing left and right. Its swings are very slow, but makes up for it in a slight increase in power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Holding the fire button begins a charge. If if strikes an enemy perfectly, it can kill them instantly! You can also move upward while swinging the charged Stamper to perform a dash straight to your target!
          </p>
          <p>
            The sub weapon for this kit is the Burst Bomb. It's good for dealing quick damage to enemies so you can finish them off with a fwe quick slashes of ink with your Stamper.
          </p>
          <p>
            It comes with the Zipcaster special, letting you leap and latch from wall to wall to get close to your enemy, so you can splash them with a jump or attack them from behind with a charged attack.
          </p>
          <p>
          This weapon can be pretty fun, but learning how to keep your distance until the time is right makes this a somewhat difficult weapon to learn. But if you don't mind a challenge with a good payout, test the waters with the Splatana Stamper!
          </p>
