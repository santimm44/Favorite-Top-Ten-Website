            <p>
              The heavy and powerful Hydra Splatling can be really fun, so long as you're at a distance. While it takes a while to fully charge the weapon, the rapid fire of the weapon makes it a really frightening weapon to encounter in a battle.
            </p>
            <p>
              It excells well in Splat Zones to get control of the zone(s) quickly. Its drawback comes from its weight and slow charging, which can make you a fish out of water if you get cornered. They say keep your friends close and your enemies closer, but you certainly do not want this to happen to you. 
            </p>
            <p>
              To keep said enemies out of your sight, this kit is equipped with the Autobombs. Autobombs will easily alert you if an enemy is near its vicinity, and even if the bomb misses its mark, you will at least have a good general idea of where your targets are.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your special weapon is the Booyah Bomb, charging the bomb with the cheers of your allies can easily take out, or at the very least scatter, any enemies near its giant explosion radius, buying your team the time to regain the upper edge in the objective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, it's perfect to try once you get used to the gameplay of easier Splatlings. Definitely, I would say give it a try!
            </p>

          <p>
            The Inkline Tri-Stringer has two firing modes: tapping to paint and holding to charge the arrows. When charged halfway, the arrows shoot at a seperate angle, but when fully charged, all arrows are concentrated to the middle, and the range of the bow is increased, which can be used to take out opponents from far away.
          </p>
          <p>
            This kit makes use of the Sprinkler sub weapon. While not the best to defeat opponents, it can be placed to slowly paint a set area its in, which can help you get your special ready!
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of, the special is the Super Chump. It's a cannon that launches dummy balloons in a set location, mimicking the jump that players usually do when moving to another teammate, before exploding together if the enemy can't destroy them in time. They're mostly for displacement and painting, which makes it really good for modes such as Splat Zones, where painting the main zone is crucial, or Clam Blitz, which can deter other enemy players from scoring their Power Clam.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I really enjoy using this weapon! It's really good for getting a lot of paint on the turf, which can give your team the upperhand when pushing for the objective!
          </p>

            The Splatana Stamper is an insane concept for a weapon! It's a chainsaw-esque sword weapon made out of a date stamp. Perfectly fitting considering that kissing the end of the sword usually marks your expiriy date right then and there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tapping the fire button allows it to swing left and right. Its swings are very slow, but makes up for it in a slight increase in power.
            Holding the fire button begins a charge. If if strikes an enemy perfectly, it can kill them instantly! You can also move upward while swinging the charged Stamper to perform a dash straight to your target!
          </p>
          <p>
            The sub weapon for this kit is the Burst Bomb. It's good for dealing quick damage to enemies so you can finish them off with a fwe quick slashes of ink with your Stamper.
          </p>
          <p>
            It comes with the Zipcaster special, letting you leap and latch from wall to wall to get close to your enemy, so you can splash them with a jump or attack them from behind with a charged attack.
          </p>
          <p>
          This weapon can be pretty fun, but learning how to keep your distance until the time is right makes this a somewhat difficult weapon to learn. But if you don't mind a challenge with a good payout, test the waters with the Splatana Stamper!

            The Splat Charger is the first of the Charger-class weapons. For essentially being Sniper Rifles, they're really fun to use!
          </p>  
          <p>
            Holding down the fire button will begin to charge the weapon, then release to fire! If it hits an opponent, it takes them out right there, nice and easy. The downside is that the charger is not that great to be painting with, which means charging your special weapon will be rather slow, keep in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            This kit also comes with Splat Bombs, the most standard of the sub weapons. However, the bomb can be utilized to make a quick getaway when someone is on your tail, or to displace any oppoenents nearby!
          </p>
          <p>
            The special it holds is the Ink Vac. As its name implies, it vaccums up any enemy projectile of ink that may be coming in your direction, so long as it's a projectile (definitely avoid the melee weapons, your fun might end early!) After a while, you can then use the Ink Vac to shoot a huge projectile at your opponents, depending on how much ink the vaccum sucked up, creatiang a bizzare, spiky explosion!
          </p>
          <p>
            Dying a lot on the front lines? This is a nice introduction to playing long-range in the long-term. Perfect your shots and winning is in the bag for you and your team!

            The Luna Blaster is a weapon that shoots large balls of exploding ink. </p>
             <p>They're very helpful in the sense that the area in which they explode can damage and defeat enemies in up to 2 shots (or 1 if your shot is spot on!). It's a very simple weapon to learn and use, and its close damage and big explosion radius makes it good against enemies that are just above or below you.
          <p>
            The Neo variation of the Luna Blaster has Fizzy Bombs. You can shake the bomb, and this makes it produce more explosions when it lands, up to three! Even if it doesn't nail a target, it makes a line of ink you can easily swim through, so it's good for covering ground AND good for dealing damage!
          </p>
          <p>
            The special weapon it has is the Ultra Stamp, a giant hammer that paints and kills extremely fast. You can use it to quickly paint areas, perfect for Splat Zones, to paint the zones, and Rainmaker, to push your team to a necessary checkpoint.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the simplicity of this weapon, it's a good weapon to learn. It's effective so long as your aim is just decent, and the kit makes this weapon an overall enjoyable weapon to use.

            The Goo Tuber is another weapon from the charger family, but this one was made for getting in middle range of opponents. </p>
            <p> It plays like the Splat Charger, but unlike the Splat charger, the Goo Tuber allows you to continuously swim in your ink with a full charge ready to use for a significantly longer time than normal. You can get in a closer range to your enemy and launch your sniping shot quickly, and they won't even know what hit them!
          </p>
          <p>
            In this kit is the Torpedo, a sub weapon that, when thrown, lock onto an opponent before launching a slew of bombs at them. Very simple to use and super effective, so long as your oppoenents don't shoot it down before it hits is mark.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has the Tenta Missiles Special, where you can lock on and fire a barrage of missles at your opponent. They can be pretty lethal if contact is made, but it's best use as a deterrant agains foes who may be close to the objective. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If you enjoy the standard Splat Charger, definitely give the Goo Tuber a try. It's a fun twist of an old favorite, and has a lot of suprise attack potential that your enemies won't be able to catch if fast enough!

            The Recycled Brella is a paper umbrella turned killing machine! 
          </p>  
          <p>
            Compared to standard brellas, where after shielding yourself with the canopy for too long leaves you vunerable, the canopy of the Recycled Brella is made to be launched again and again, while the main weapon takes care of dealing the big damage. It's lightweight material also makes movement much more possible, to where you can easily overwhelm your opponents with its damage output.
          </p>
          <p>
            It gets better, too! It's sub weapon is the Toxic Mist, which slows down enemies and depletes their ink tanks, which can leave them extremely vunverable to shots of any kind. Best to use this on opponents you know will be rushing for the objective.
          </p>
          <p>
            This weapon's special weapon is the Triple Splashdown: Leap up and then strike down, with you and two exploding fists to help deal the strike. You can be killed during this attack, but even if you are, the fists can still do its job of dealing damage, so not all is lost! It's best utilized as a panic button if you're ever backed in a corner.
          </p>
          <p>
            This weapon can be really fun to use with how fast and frantic its kit incentivizes. That being said that makes this kit a bit tricky to learn, but if you can master it, foes beware!

            The Tentatek Splattershot takes the standard shooter weapon and gives it a kit that can devastate your foes easily, which makes it one of the more feared weapon kits in the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Splattershot may be the most basic of weapons, it's still a really good all-rounder weapon to use, and this weapon is given more strength through its kit!
          </p>
          <p>
            It has a standard Splat Bomb which can easily take out an enemy, or at the very least damage them. This can give you enough time to close the gap to take them out. Being able to use the Splattershot and Splat Bombs in tandem will get you the most use out of this kit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The special it has is the all powerful Triple Inkstrike. You get three becons to throw, which will direct the 3 Inkstrike to strike in hit in that area. They have a lot of damage power, and anyone who gets caught in it is almost guaranteed to be wiped out in an instant!
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't sleep on this kit. I highly recommend this weapon. It's fun, it's beginner free, and you can make a lot of bank with the Tentatek Splattershot by your side!

            Say hello to my most used weapon: The Splash-O-matic!
          </p>
          <p>
            With a rapid fire and dead-on accurate firing range, this weapon is one of the scariest weapons to come across. It's fast, it's deadly, it strikes anything that moves. If you want a weapon that does it all, this is the one to look at.
          </p>
          <p>
            It comes with Burst Bombs for its sub weapons. Just with that knowledge alone, being able to set a 1-2 kill by throwing a Burst Bomb at your enemy before pelting them with the Splash-o-matic's firepower makes it a perfect fit for this kit. Be mindful of your usage though, you don't want to run out of ink when it's most crucial to take out the trash.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make up for the weapon's midrange gameaplay, the special it holds is the Crab Tank. Take the huge explosion power of blasters with the firing and damage rate of a Hydra Splatling, and you get a monster of a robot that's more than willing to give you what your main weapon can't. If the pastry of victory already looked good, the addition of the Crab Tank just added more sprinkles in the mix!
          </p>
          <p>
            PLAY! THIS! WEAPON! It is a phenoeminal weapon that has helped me win countless matches, and hopefully, it will help you too!

            While the Splash-O-matic is my most used weapon, my all-time favoirte weapon (at least for now, subject to change), is the Luna Blaster!
          </p>
          <p>
            It works just like the Luna Blaster Neo: balls of ink explode in air that can deal easy damage to enemies. It's a method that works without fail! Of course, it's mid-range means that you still can get hit by Chargers or Stringers from far away. But don't you worry about that!
          </p>
          <p>
            Where it excels is in its kit. It comes with Splat Bombs which is perfect for this kit. While it takes the Luna Blaster up to two shots to kill someone, the Splat Bomb can help a lot in taking people out. If the bomb damages someone even slightly, they're simply one Luna Blaster shot away to be defeated!
          </p>
          <p>
            The special for this weapon is the Zipcaster. Pairing the huge blast radius of the Luna Blaster with the Zipcaster's ability to be anywhere on the map at any time, and it becomes one of the most threatening combo in just about any match!
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my pick for my favorite weapon kit in Splatoon 3! It's fast, it's strong, and it's a ruthless combo! Take a chance and try this weapon out, the results will not disappoint you!
