### Comments: Overall the website seems good and is accurate to the figma, a few things to note though. The cards on the index are very tall unlike how it seems in the figma and when in tablet mode there is a lot of space between the bottom of the page and the cards. There is slight horizontal overflow on both of the top 10 pages. Also not sure if this is a problem but although it's how it is on the figma, the hero images in tablet mode get really thin and cut off a lot of the actual content in the image itself. Other than those few things, I think it looks good!
